   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Rationale:
   - Many reports only need ONE payment per booking (e.g., latest successful).
   - Use a window function to pick the most recent successful payment per booking.
   - Reduces join cardinality (â‰¤1 row per booking from payments).
   - Requires MySQL 8.0+ for window functions.
